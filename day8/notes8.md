~~You may notice the way I'm calculating the antinode points in parts 1 and 2 are different - the signs are flipped. I'm still not quite sure why this leads to the right answer for each part. Making the signs consistent certainly doesn't give the right answer.~~

Nevermind. Part 1 had the correct logic. Part 2 just happened to work anyway because the signs were correct in the where loop checking for other equidistant points, and it backtracked over the bad math.
